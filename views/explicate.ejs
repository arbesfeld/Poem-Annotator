    <textarea id="input">	“Applauding”—the opening gerund of Claude McKay’s 1922 <t>“The Harlem Dancer”</t>—is perhaps the only awkward element of the poem. While the rest of the poem assumes the slow and dignified form of a sonnet, the first line thrusts us hastily into the world of the Harlem nightclub—as if the speaker is mid-thought as the poem begins. This first line’s transition from awkward gerund to song-like rhyme (“youths” with “prostitutes”) compounded with the shift from the positivity of “laughter” and “youths” to the seedy “prostitutes” establishes one of the main conflicts in the poem: how does beauty exist within the constraints of structure and order? While it may seem paradoxical at first that the upbeat nightclub scene is described in such a metered sonnet form, the connection between theme and form becomes clear by the end of the poem. Just as the “Harlem Dancer” is confined by her performance, the speaker is similarly confined to the rigid form of the English sonnet.

	Beyond the first line, McKay’s poem is filled with apparent contradictions. Our dancer is “half-clothed” but still “perfect” (2) and has a single voice that sounds like a symphony of instruments. The line break after “blended flutes” is also interesting. By separating the instrument from the “black players” (3), I wonder if McKay is trying to highlight race by having the reader form an assumption about the musicians and then undermining that assumption. The likening of the club scene to a picnic day in line four is yet another example of how the speaker confuses our assumptions. By the end of the first six lines, the reader is exceedingly puzzled. A wild Harlem club and half-naked performer are being described in slow, metered sonnet form and the reader is torn between having aesthetic respect for the dancer, and pity for the situation that she is in.

	We are introduced to the speaker in line seven of the poem, as he uses “to me” (7) to distance himself from the previously described youth. However, just as the youths watch her “body sway” (2), the speaker, too, focuses on her “swaying” (7) by likening her to a palm tree (an image from McKay’s African heritage). The speaker’s observation that she has “grown lovelier for passing through a storm” (8) suggests that she is even more beautiful for having endured some kind of conflict. The speaker’s world is entirely different from the youth of the nightclub. He does not fixate on the details of her appearance—we barely know what the dancer looks like. Rather, she is described through her actions—“singing”, “dancing”, and “swaying.” We trust the speaker when he says that the dancer is “perfect” because the form of the poem is so perfect. Moreover, the somber form of the sonnet makes her “swaying” seem more melancholy and monotonous than sexual or enticing. Once again, form seems to contrast from theme.

	The speaker “snaps back” into reality in line nine, when he realizes that he has been failing to describe her physical appearance. The noticeable pause after “through a storm” (8) and the sudden shift from symbolism to the physical imagery of “shiny curls / Profusely [falling]” (9-10) suggests that the speaker is almost embarrassed to have been describing the dancer with such grandiose. Perhaps the speaker finds it hard to reconcile the dancer’s strength and pride with the subservience of her situation. We can connect the “and, tossing coins in praise” (10) to the end of the first line, as if the entire middle section of the poem is merely a fantasy of the speaker which is interrupted by the loudness of the coins. Once back in “reality,” we see even more contradictions in the speaker’s descriptions. “Boys” and “girls” (11)—words that are usually associated with innocence—“devour” (12) the dancer, and their “passionate gaze” (12) seem to contrast from their earlier laughter. Despite the speaker’s numerous contradictions, we still trust him. Like the speaker, we are confused; we don’t know whether to hate the youth for their superficiality or appreciate their exuberance. Moreover, we are taken by the hypnotic nature of the dancer but simultaneously disappointed by her confinement.

	Of course, the couplet should resolve our uncertainty! At first glance, it does: “But, looking at her falsely-smiling face / I knew her self was not in that strange place” (13-14). The speaker is very certain of his conclusion. Whereas before the dancer was described in comparisons and potentials such as “seemed,” here, the speaker can look at her face and “know” that she is not satisfied. Initially, this seems like an accurate reading of the poem. Just as the dancer is confined in her situation, the poem itself is constricted to strict sonnet form. The contradictions throughout the poem suggest that the speaker struggles with his impression of the dancer, but ultimately concludes that she is unhappy despite her strength and power.

While I think this is a valid interpretation of the poem, I am surprised that the speaker could come to such a decisive conclusion about the dancer from simply looking at her face. It would seem that the dancer’s body and actions would say just as much about the dancer’s thoughts as her face would. Thus, I believe that the final couplet is more an indication of the speaker’s confinement than the dancer’s. The semicolon at the end of the final quatrain and the opening “but” of the couplet seem forced, as if the speaker knows that he must employ a volta followed by a momentous turn in order for the explication to be considered a true Shakespearean sonnet.

	A closer reading of the poem supports the interpretation that the speaker is just as confined as the dancer. The speaker starts describing the scene, but his thoughts drift to Africa as he likens the dancer to a swaying palm tree and her voice to the flutes of black players. It is in this middle section that the speaker’s thoughts seem most clear—the language is song-like and does not contain the contradictions that are present throughout the rest of the poem. However, he cannot stay in this state for long, as the “tossing [of] coins in praise” (10) awaken the speaker to the reality of the nightclub and back to the illogicalities of everyday life. As much as the speaker wishes to return to the simple and straightforward world of graceful dancing and palm trees, he is stuck in some seedy nightclub—no better than the “boys” and “girls” that surround him. Thus, the speaker is just as confined in his life as the Harlem Dancer is in her performance.

	An initial reading of McKay’s poem yields a straightforward interpretation: that the traditional and restricted form of the Shakespearean sonnet mirrors the dancer’s own confinement in her performance. However, I believe that the form speaks just as much to the speaker’s limitations as it does to the dancer’s confinement to the stage. Perhaps “The Harlem Dancer” refers to not only the actual dancer, but also to the speaker who constantly “dances” between his idealistic view of African life and the sobering reality of the nightclub. “The Harlem Dancer” uses the sonnet form to paint a melancholy picture of a predatory, “devouring” crowd that seems to consume the life of both the dancer and the speaker. It is interesting to see how McKay uses the structure of the sonnet to add meaning. Whereas many modernists such as Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot moved away from rigid forms in their poems, McKay embraced the sonnet in “The Harlem Dancer” to show the speaker’s alienation from the world around him.
